# women-s-lacrosse-performance-analytics-mock

## Project Overview
This project is a **mock sports analytics project** inspired by a live Purdue Data Mine–style collaboration completed at Youngstown State University with the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics – Sports Performance.

The purpose of this mock version is to demonstrate **data analytics, statistical analysis, and visualization skills** using **synthetic data**, while preserving confidentiality of real athlete information.

## Problem Statement
Analyze athlete performance, workload, and wellness metrics to:
- Understand performance trends
- Identify risk patterns
- Support data-driven training decisions

## Dataset
- Synthetic (mock) athlete performance dataset
- Modeled after real-world sports science data
- Includes:
  - Jump Height
  - Peak Power / Body Mass
  - Training Load
  - Wellness Metrics (Soreness, Energy, Stress)
  - Time-series practice data

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performance metric evaluation
- Time-series workload analysis
- Visualization of wellness and performance trends

## Key Insights
- Jump height shows strong association with peak power metrics
- Training load trends help identify potential overuse periods
- Wellness metrics provide additional context for athlete readiness

## Notes
This repository contains a **sanitized mock version** of a real team-based sports analytics project.  
All data is synthetic and created solely for demonstration purposes.
